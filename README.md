# jupyterlab_practice
## Module 7

This repository was created to practice what we learned in **Module 7**, to reproduce the environment refere to: [environment.yaml]('https://github.com/isg44/jupyterlab_practice/blob/developer-1/environment.yaml')<br>

We have two branches: 
* **main** - README.md and .gitignore
* **developer-1** - exercises from questions 1 to 13


The exercises covered an overview of JupyterLab intermediate knowledge, such as:  
* Create a new Jupyter notebook
* Work between code cells and markdowns
* How to use $LaTeX$
* Magic commands
* Export to HTML without input cells
* ran Shell commands in jupyter
* Git and GitHub version management
